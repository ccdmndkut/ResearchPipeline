## üöÄ How to Use the Enhanced System

### 1. Start the Enhanced Server
```bash
cd research-assistant
python -m app.main_enhanced
```

### 2. Test the Enhanced Orchestrator
```python
# Via WebSocket
ws = websocket.connect("ws://localhost:8000/ws")
ws.send(json.dumps({
    "query": "machine learning in healthcare",
    "parameters": {
        "databases": ["arxiv", "semantic_scholar"],
        "max_results": 20
    },
    "audience": "academic",
    "format": "detailed"
}))
```

### 3. Use the Formatter API
```python
# Format existing results
response = requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/format", json={
    "results": research_results,
    "audience": "business",
    "format": "summary",
    "citation_style": "apa"
})
```

### 4. Monitor Performance
```python
# Get metrics
metrics = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/metrics")
print(metrics.json())

# Check active sessions
sessions = requests.get("http://localhost:8000/api/sessions")
print(f"Active connections: {sessions.json()['total']}")
```

### 5. Toggle Feature Flags
```python
# Enable/disable features at runtime
requests.post("http://localhost:8000/api/features", json={
    "enhanced_orchestrator": True,
    "response_formatter": True,
    "parallel_processing": True,
    "quality_scoring": True,
    "caching": True
})
```
